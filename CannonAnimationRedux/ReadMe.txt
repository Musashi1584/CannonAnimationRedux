[h1]Overhauls all cannon animations.[/h1]

In the new animations the soldier hold the cannon, well like a cannon, and not like a rifle.

The animations are overriden if the soldier holds one of the basegame cannons.
TLE and mod weapons are not touched.

There are some minor inaccuracies in the animations that i might fix in the future.
